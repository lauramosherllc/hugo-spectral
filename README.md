# Hugo Spectral | [Demo](https://lauramosher.com/hugo-spectral/)

This is a full port of HTML5UP's [Spectral](https://html5up.net/spectral) theme, free for personal and commercial use.

It's similar to the [Spectral port by sbruder](https://github.com/sbruder/spectral), but with the intention to utilize the full power of the Spectral theme plus all the features that Hugo provides.

- Post (default) and page archetypes.
- Taxonomies
- Font Awesome 6 Free (Solid, Regular)
- Social Media Icons (Font Awesome 6 Brands)

## Mods

- Spectral's homepage sections (one, two, three) are now modular (wide and split), can be applied in any order, can have custom styles applied, and can be used as many times as preferred.
- Create your own layouts and utilize the sections are not limited in number, can apply custom styles, and can be placed in any order.
- Adds specific list and single layouts for posts; separate from defaults.
- New styles built specifically for blog rendering.
- Better Taxonomy and Term pages.
- Pages can be switched to HTML markup for full control over layout.
